          <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
          <li>
            You are X and your friend is O. Players take turns putting their
            marks in empty squares, by clicking on them.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first player to get 3 of its marks in a row (up, down, across,
            or diagonally) is the winner.
          </li>
          <li>
            When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3
            marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
          </li>
